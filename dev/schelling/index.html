Agents.jl&#39;s tools manage the rest of the path to producing data and visualizations (Fig. 1). We now demonstrate Agents.jl&#39;s architecture and features through building Schelling&#39;s segregation model.</p><p><img src="../agentscomponents.png" alt="Fig. 1. __Path from building a model to gaining information from the model using Agents.jl.__ The box in cyan is what the user has to provide and the boxes in green are what Agents.jl provides."/></p><p>We implement the following definition of Schelling&#39;s segregation model:</p><ul><li>Agents are of two kind (0 or 1).</li><li>Each agent has eight neighbors (Moore neighborhoods).</li><li>If an agent is in the same group with at least three neighbors, then it is happy.</li><li>If an agent is unhappy, it keeps moving to new locations until it is happy.</li></ul><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Defining-a-model-object-1" href="#Defining-a-model-object-1">Defining a model object</a></h3><p>Building models using Agents.jl, we always start by defining three basic objects: one for the model, one for the the agents and one for the space.</p><p>A model object is a subtype of <code>AbstractModel</code>. Making the model a subtype of <code>AbstractModel</code> will make Agents.jl methods available to the model. It needs to have the following three fields: <code>scheduler</code>, <code>space</code>, and <code>agents</code>. We can add more fields if needed.</p><p>The <code>scheduler</code> field accepts a function that defines the order with which agents will activate at each step. The function should accept the model object as its input and return a list of agent indices. Agents.jl provides three schedulers: <code>as_added</code> to activate agents as they have been added to the model, <code>random_activation</code> to activate agents randomly, and <code>partial_activation</code> to activate only a random fraction of agents at each step.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using Agents

AbstractModel type for the Schelling Model

Object should always be a subtype of AbstractModel.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
mutable struct SchellingModel{T&lt;:Integer, Y&lt;:AbstractArray,
                              Z&lt;:AbstractSpace} &lt;: AbstractModel 

  &quot;A field of the model for a space object, always a subtype of AbstractSpace.&quot;

  &quot;The minimum number of neighbors for agent to be happy.&quot;

end</code></pre><p>It is best to make any model parameter a field of the model object. We add the minimum number of neighbors of the same kind for an agent to be happy as a field of the model (<code>min_to_be_happy</code>). </p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Defining-an-agent-object-1" href="#Defining-an-agent-object-1">Defining an agent object</a></h3><p>Next, we define an agent object. Agent objects are subtypes of <code>AbstractAgent</code> and should always have the following fields: <code>id</code> which stores agent IDs as integers, and <code>pos</code> to store each agent&#39;s position. Agent positions can be tuple of integers as coordinates of nodes of a grid (1D, 2D or 3D). Positions can also be integers only, referring to the number of a node in an irregular network.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;&quot;&quot;
AbstractAgent type for the Schelling Agent

Object should always be a subtype of AbstractAgent.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
mutable struct SchellingAgent{T&lt;:Integer} &lt;: AbstractAgent
  &quot;The identifier number of the agent.&quot;
  id::T
  &quot;The x, y location of the agent.&quot;
  pos::Tuple{T, T}
  &quot;&quot;&quot;
  Whether or not the agent is happy with cell.

  Where true is &quot;happy&quot; and false is &quot;unhappy&quot;

  &quot;&quot;&quot;
  mood::Bool
  &quot;The group of the agent, determines mood as it interacts with neighbors.&quot;
  group::T
end</code></pre><p>We add two more fields for this model, namely a <code>mood</code> field which will store <code>true</code> for a happy agent and <code>false</code> for an unhappy one, and an <code>group</code> field which stores <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> representing two groups.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Defining-a-space-object-1" href="#Defining-a-space-object-1">Defining a space object</a></h3><p>Finally, we define a space object. The space object is always a subtype of <code>AbstractSpace</code> and should have at least the following three fields. First, a <code>space</code> field which holds the spatial structure of the model. Agents.jl uses network structures from the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl">LightGraphs package</a> to represent space.  It provides 1D, 2D and 3D grids. The grids may have periodic boundary conditions, meaning nodes on the left and right edges and top and bottom edges are connected to one another. Furthermore, the nodes on a grid may have von Neumann neighborhoods, i.e. only connect to their orthogonal neighbors, or Moore neighborhoods, i.e. connect to their orthogonal and diagonal neighbors. Users may also provide arbitrary networks as their model&#39;s spatial structure.</p><p>The second field of the space object is the <code>dimensions</code> of the grid or network. Lastly, every space object should have an <code>agent_positions</code> field. This field is an array of arrays for each node of the network. Each inner array will record the ID of the agents on that position. Agents.jl keeps the position of agents in two places. One in each agent&#39;s object and one in the <code>agent_positions</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;The space of the experiment.&quot;
mutable struct MyGrid{T&lt;:Integer, Y&lt;:AbstractArray} &lt;: AbstractSpace
  &quot;Dimensions of the grid.&quot;
  dimensions::Tuple{T, T}
  &quot;The space type.&quot;
  space::SimpleGraph
  &quot;An array of arrays for each grid node.&quot;
  agent_positions::Y  
end</code></pre><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Instantiating-the-model-1" href="#Instantiating-the-model-1">Instantiating the model</a></h3><p>Now that we have defined the basic objects, we should instantiate the model. We put the model instantiation in a function so that it will be easy to recreate the model and change its parameters.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;Function to instantiate the model.&quot;

Any ABM model should have at least one and at most two step functions. An <em>agent step function</em> is always required. Such an agent step function defines what happens to an agent when it activates. Sometimes we will need also need a function that changes all agents at once, or changes a model property. In such cases, we can also provide a <em>model step function</em>.</p><p>An agent step function should only accept two arguments, the first of which an agent object and the second of which a model object.
